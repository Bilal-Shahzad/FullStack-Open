<!-- Creating and nesting components  -->
Reacts made out of components - 
Compoonents are UI that has its own logic and apperance 
Components can be a small button or as big as a page 

React components are JS functions that return markup 

Ex:
function MyButton() {
    return (
        <button> I'm a button </button>

    ):
}
Now that MyButton has been declared we can nest it into another component- 

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
MyButton starts with a capital letter that is how you know its a react component 
They asll start will capital letters while HTML tags will be lower case 

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
Export defualt keywords specify the mian component in file

<!-- Writing markup with JSX  -->

the markup syntax us optional but most react projects use JSX for convenience.

JSX is stricter than html 
Your component also cant return multiple JSX and have to have a shared parent like div or an empty wrapper -
function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
    </>
  );
}
