Focus on backend development using Node.js.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.
Course material based on Node.js version v18.13.0; ensure your version is up-to-date.
Unlike browser-side JavaScript, Node.js supports the latest features without transpilation.

Setup and Configuration:
npm (Node Package Manager) is used for managing JavaScript packages.
Initiate a new project with npm init in an appropriate directory.
Generated package.json file contains project information.
Modify scripts in package.json to include a start script: "start": "node index.js"


Package.json Overview:

package.json example:
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Matti Luukkainen",
  "license": "MIT"
}


Creating the "Hello World" Application:
Add a simple index.js file to the project root.
console.log('hello world');
Run the program using node index.js or as an npm script with npm start.

npm Scripts Usage:
It is customary for npm projects to execute tasks using npm scripts.
npm start runs the application using the script defined in package.json.
npm test (commonly used) is defined by default; currently echoes an error message.
