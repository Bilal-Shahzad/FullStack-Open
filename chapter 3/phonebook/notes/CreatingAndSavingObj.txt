Models are constructor functions creating JavaScript objects based on parameters.
Objects created with the model have model properties, including save method.

note.save().then(result => {
  console.log('note saved!')
  mongoose.connection.close()
})

Save method stores the object in the database.
Event handler closes the database connection after the save operation.
