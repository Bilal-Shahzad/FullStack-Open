# Serving Static Files from the Backend

1. Deploying frontend:
   - Copy 'dist' directory to the backend root.

2. Use Express static middleware:
   - Add `app.use(express.static('dist'))` to serve static content.
   - Requests to `/index.html` or `/` show the React frontend.
   - Requests to `/api/notes` are handled by the backend.

3. Update frontend's API base URL to a relative path:
   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios'
   const baseUrl = '/api/notes'
