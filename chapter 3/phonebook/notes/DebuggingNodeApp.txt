# Debugging Node Applications

## Debugging Tools:
- Debugging Node applications requires efficient tools and methods.
- Console printing is a common and effective debugging technique.
  
## Visual Studio Code Debugger:
- Visual Studio Code provides a debugger for Node applications.
- Launch the debugger in debugging mode or with "Run" (newer versions).
- Use breakpoints and the console to inspect variables and application state.


// Example launch.json configuration for Visual Studio Code:
"configurations": [
  {
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Launch Program",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/index.js",
    "skipFiles": [
