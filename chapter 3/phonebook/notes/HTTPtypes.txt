# About HTTP Request Types

## HTTP Request Properties:
- **Safety:** GET and HEAD methods are recommended to be safe, meaning no server-side changes.
- **Idempotency:** GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE should have the property of idempotence, producing the same result with repeated requests.

## Safety and Idempotence:
- Safety ensures no side effects on the server.
- Idempotence means the result is the same for N identical requests.

## Request Types:
- GET and HEAD are safe.
- POST is neither safe nor idempotent.
- PUT and DELETE are idempotent.

## Middleware:
- Express json-parser is a middleware.
- Middleware handles request and response objects.
- Middlewares are executed in order.

## Custom Middleware:
- Example middleware logs request information.
- Order matters; json-parser used before custom middleware.

## Unknown Endpoint Middleware:
- Catches requests to non-existent routes.
- Returns a 404 error in JSON format.
